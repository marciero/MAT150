Statistics in real world applications requires statistical software. We will use the R statistical software for most of our computations and analysis. No prior experience with statistical software or programming is assumed. R is free and ``open source''. To access R, register for a free account on Posit Cloud, available at \url{https://posit.cloud/}. Alternatively, you can download and install R onto your personal machine from \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}. You can download the version for your computer (note that newer Macs with M1 chip require the arm64 version) and install like you would other software - by simply clicking on the downloaded installation file. Later, those installing R on personal machines will also install RStudio. RStudio is a workspace environment for doing R and managing your work that is very convenient. (In fact, the Posit Cloud account automatically puts you in the RStudio environment.) We will look at this in class though. For now, you simply need to either register on Posit Cloud or download and install R on a personal machine.\\

We will use computers often during class, and you should bring a personal machine to class. {\bf Please let me know if you do not have access to a laptop computer.}

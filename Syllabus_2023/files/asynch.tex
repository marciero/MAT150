This course will run as an {\it asynchronous} course, which means that there are no regular meeting times where we meet as a group. The course content is entirely online, and will be run through Brightspace. Everything you need to do will be indicated and either appear there as content or as links to content elsewhere. The scheduling is thus flexible according to your schedule. But because the course is compressed into six weeks, the pace is very quick, and so it is important that you work every day on the content; perhaps with one day off per week. If you do this, you will find the pace very manageable.\\

Asynchronous does not mean that you work in isolation, however. You will be responsible for posting on discussion forums on the Brighspace site. You are also encouraged to post questions there and to respond to other students. I am also available via email or zoom meeting at the office hours above or by appointment.

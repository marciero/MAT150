The following were adapted from University of Washington policy on academic integrity in CS courses.
\begin{enumerate} 
\item
You must indicate on your submission any assistance you received. For programs, proper citation usually takes the form of comments in the program. It is also important to make sure that the assistance you receive consists of general advice that does not cross the boundary into using code or answers written by someone else. It is fine to discuss ideas and strategies, but you should be careful to write your programs on your own. 
\item
You must not share actual program code with other students. In particular, you should not ask anyone to give you a copy of their code or, conversely, give your code to another student who asks you for it; nor should you post your solutions on the web, in public repositories, or any other publicly accessible place. Similarly, you should not discuss your algorithmic strategies to such an extent that you and your collaborators end up turning in exactly the same code. Discuss ideas together, but do the coding on your own.

\item You must not look at solution sets or program code from other years, nor should you make your own solutions publicly available even after the due date. 

\item You must be prepared to explain any program code you submit.
\item Modifying code or other artifacts does not make it your own.
\end{enumerate}

With the help of the UNE Makerspace students will construct a game board, pieces, and/or other accouterments required to play their games or puzzles with others. All attempts should be made to retain the integrity and appropriate impartiality (or lack thereof) to represent the theoretical game each student is studying. These games will be the property of the student upon completion of the course, but if a second copy can be constructed then the instructor would appreciate one!
